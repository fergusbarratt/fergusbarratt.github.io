TinyTN is our proprietary tensorization library. 
It enables automatic model compression of arbitrary deep learning models by leveraging redundancy in the internal structure of the weight matrices. 
Doing so allows us to achieve best-in-class results for model compression, latency, and throughput, across a range of model footprints -- from ResNets to large language models.
